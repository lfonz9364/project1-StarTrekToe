# Project 1: Star Trek Toe

### Technology Used
* Jquery
* CSS
* HTML

### Approach

I choose to breakdown the projects into small problems and try to solve the small problems one by one. First of all, I solved the problem to ensure there will be an image show up when the cell clicked and prevent players to click at the same cell. Second, the game logic, based on the winning condition of Tic Tac Toe where each player must try to mark three cells adjacent to each other, either diagonally, vertically or horizontally, where translated into a combination of functions to continuously check whether the condition is met. Third, if the winning condition met then the screen will be covered with announcement of the winner's name. Last but not least, players could return to play the next round by closing the screen.

### What I Learned

Jquery is really helpful in optimizing code lines. There are features of Jquery that only required several words that could cover lines of Javascript functions. However, it is still require the programmer's creativity in using each one of the code to replace Javascript codes properly.
